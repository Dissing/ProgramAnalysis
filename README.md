# ProgramAnalysis02242

## Open Individual Tasks:


### Generalize Analysis Definition & Worklist
Assignee: Lasse

### Depth First Spanning Tree & Reverse Post-order
Assignee: Thomas

### Strongly Connected Components & Natural Loops
Assignee: Thomas


## Not that important tasks:

### Program Graph Visualization
Assignee: Lasse
- A module which translates the program graph into Tikz
- Okay to layout node positions manually, but look into https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/337930/algorithmic-graph-drawing-with-tikz-pgf

### Proper Error Handling
Assignee: Lasse
- Requires extensions to the AST and ProgramGraph. It is therefore best postponed until the stabilization of the control flow analysis.
